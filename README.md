All code here is from my personal creation, you don't need to worry about anything with copyright, since I don't ask of that.
Any modification to the code is appreciated and automatically permitted. No requirements for keeping the old version.


What I did:
1.node class in PURE C.
2.queue based on node, in PURE C, too.
3.tree based on node & tree, in PURE C, too.
4.network based on nodes, in PURE C, undone yet.
5.drawing library, based on open library <Graphics>. in PURE C.

Anything changed after this statement will be marked below.

Best Regard!
